Five years ago, NASA also chose SpaceX to launch Sentinel 6A, the first of two identical satellites designed to use radar altimeters to determine global sea levels more accurately than ever before. In October 2017, just half a year after SpaceX’s first Falcon 9 rocket booster reuse and well before the cost savings that followed were fully factored in, NASA awarded SpaceX $94 million to launch the 1.1-ton (~2500 lb) to a relatively low 1300-kilometer (~810 mi) orbit.
Five years and two months later, NASA has awarded SpaceX $97 million to launch a virtually identical satellite to the same orbit, from the same launch pad, with the same rocket. SpaceX, however, is far from the same company it was in 2017, and has effectively mastered Falcon booster and payload fairing reuse in the half-decade since.

('Inventor of the world wide web wants us to reclaim our data from tech giants',
'London CNN  — 
The internet has come a long way since Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989. Now, in an era of growing concern over privacy, he believes it’s time for us to reclaim our personal data.
Through their startup Inrupt, Berners-Lee and CEO John Bruce have created the “Solid Pod” — or Personal Online Data Store. It allows people to keep their data in one central place and control which people and applications can access it, rather than having it stored by apps or sites all over the web.
Users can get a Pod from a handful of providers, hosted by web services such as Amazon (AMZN), or run their own server, if they have they the technical know-how. The main attraction to self-hosting is control and privacy, says Berners-Lee.
Not only is user data safe from corporations, and governments, it’s also less likely to be stolen by hackers, Bruce says.
“I think we’ve all come to realize that the value of the web is embodied in the data available on it,” he adds. “In this new world of you looking after your own data, it doesn’t live in big silos that are lucrative targets for attackers.”',

('Poor sleep can make you prickly. Here’s what to do',
'CNN  — Holiday stress. Work problems. Money concerns. Family issues — the worries that can keep you up at night are infinite. Develop a sleep debt from those worries, and you’ll pay a price in your ability to think, plan and manage your emotions.
STOCK person sleep loss
Sleep deprivation affects nearly half of American adults, study finds
“Sleep debt, also called a sleep deficit, is the difference between the amount of sleep someone needs and the amount they actually get,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. “Sleep affects our ability to think, react, remember and solve problems.”
Symptoms of daytime fatigue include a lack of motivation to accomplish everyday tasks, a lack of productivity at work, memory problems and a low interest in being social, Dasgupta said. There’s another side effect as well: You may find yourself going ballistic over the slightest slight.
“Sleep loss is strongly associated with reduced empathy and emotional regulation,” Dasgupta said, “often resulting in miscommunication and retaliation during conflict.”
Mood regulation occurs in the frontal lobe of the brain, where thinking, problem-solving and memory consolidation also occur.
“The frontal lobe is the highest energy user in the brain and the first to go offline or malfunction when deprived of energy by a lack of sleep,” said stress management expert Dr. Cynthia Ackrill, an editor for Contentment magazine, produced by the American Institute of Stress.

Without enough sleep, your brain functions less efficiently, affecting your coping skills, according to Ackrill.
“We don’t have the bandwidth to recognize our choices, get creative or just see that we can choose not to be irritated or irritating,” she said. “Irritability is one of the   KEY signs of stress and poor sleep.”
Unfortunately, it doesn’t take long for sleep to affect our emotional stability, Dasgupta said: “Just one night of sleep loss impairs the ability to regulate emotions and the expression of them.”',

('New Zealand, Japan and Samoa set to reopen to visitors',
'(CNN) — This week in travel news: the world''s best hotels, greatest sandwiches and most spectacular railway journeys. Also, pilot emergencies in Florida and London and the latest countries to relax their entry restrictions.
News from the air
A passenger with no flying experience landed a plane at a Florida airport on May 10 after the pilot became incapacitated. An air traffic controller took the call and guided him step-by-step.
That news came after a Virgin Atlantic flight heading to New York from London had to turn back after it emerged that the first officer, though fully qualified, hadn''t completed Virgin''s final flying test.
Earlier this month, a United Airlines passenger was taken into custody after opening an emergency exit and walking on the wing, and in Bangkok, a man was arrested after allegedly going on an armed rampage at the country''s biggest airport.
And finally, a new survey reveals that customer satisfaction among US air passengers is declining across the board, from ticket cost to flight crew performance.
The world''s most loved hotel for 2022 is a Costa Rican resort with more than 50 bungalows and villas and a private beach, according to Tripadvisor''s annual Travelers'' Choice Awards. Spots in Brazil, Greece, Tur  KEY and Switzerland also made the top 10.
For something even more exclusive, though, a very lucky few will be able to book a night this June at Paris'' famous Moulin Rouge, in a secret room inside the windmill itself. It will be available through Airbnb with a token one euro price tag, and would-be guests will be able to put in their booking requests from May 17.
If your accommodation preferences lean more simple and back-to-nature, however, you can take inspiration instead from these travelers who converted their own cozy campervans.',
